# CO₂ Injection Simulation – Synthetic Reservoir (MRST Project)

This project simulates **CO₂ injection into a 2D synthetic saline aquifer** using the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). It visualizes the movement of the CO₂ plume over time and forms the foundation for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon storage studies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To model and visualize the dynamic behavior of injected CO₂ in a homogeneous reservoir environment, and build transferable knowledge in:
- Numerical reservoir simulation
- Subsurface flow visualization
- Plume migration monitoring (for CCS or EOR)

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Framework

- **MRST Version**: 2025a
- **Modules Used**:  
  `ad-core`, `ad-blackoil`, `mrst-gui`
- **Simulation Engine**: Autodiff-based (`simulateScheduleAD`)
- **Language**: MATLAB

```matlab
fluid = initSimpleADIFluid('phases', 'WG', ...
    'mu', [1, 0.06]*centi*poise, ...
    'rho', [1000, 700], ...
    'n', [2, 2]);

state0 = initResSol(G, 100*barsa, [1, 0]);  % 100% brine saturation
```
